django-beanstalkd
=================

*django-greenstalk* is a convenience wrapper for the [beanstalkd][beanstalkd]
[Python Bindings][greenstalk].

It is a fork from the original django-beanstalkd project which was left
unmaintained. As the [beanstalkc][beanstalkc] python bindings are also no longer
maintained I switched to the python only implementation
[greenstalk][greenstalk]. Apart from the different underlying library, the
project is mostly a dropin replacement for the old django-beanstalk project.

With django-greenstalk, you can code jobs as well as clients in a Django project
with minimal overhead in your application. Server connections etc. all take
place in django-greenstalk and don't unnecessarily clog your application code.

This library is based in large part on Fred Wenzel's [django-gearman][django-gearman].
If you're looking for synchronous execution of jobs, check out [Gearman][gearman]
and Fred's library! Beanstalkd is useful for background processes only.

Installation
------------
It's the same for both the client and worker instances of your django project:

    pip install django-beanstalkd

Add ``django_beanstalkd`` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` section of `settings.py`.

Specify the following settings in your local settings.py file if your beanstalkd
server isn't accessible on port 11300 of localhost (127.0.0.1):

    # My beanstalkd server
    BEANSTALK_SERVER = '127.0.0.1:11300'  # the default value

If necessary, you can specify a pattern to be applied to your beanstalk worker
functions:

    # beanstalk job name pattern. Namespacing etc goes here. This is the pattern
    # your jobs will register as with the server, and that you'll need to use
    # when calling them from a non-django-beanstalkd client.
    # replacement patterns are:
    # %(app)s : django app name the job is filed under
    # %(job)s : job name
    BEANSTALK_JOB_NAME = '%(app)s.%(job)s'


Workers
-------
### Registering jobs
Create a file `beanstalk_jobs.py` in any of your django apps, and define as many
jobs as functions as you like. The job must accept a single string argument as
passed by the caller.

Mark each of these functions as beanstalk jobs by decorating them with
`django_beanstalkd.beanstalk_job`.

For an example, look at the `beanstalk_example` app's `benstalk_jobs.py` file.

### Starting a worker
To start a worker, run `python manage.py beanstalk_worker`. It will start
serving all registered jobs.

To spawn more than one worker (if, e.g., most of your jobs are I/O bound),
use the `-w` option:

    python manage.py beanstalk_worker -w 5

will start five workers.

Since the process will keep running while waiting for and executing jobs,
you probably want to run this in a _screen_ session or similar.

Clients
-------
To make your workers work, you need a client app passing data to them. Create
and instance of the `django_beanstalkd.BeanstalkClient` class and `call` a
function with it:

    from django_beanstalkd import BeanstalkClient
    client = BeanstalkClient()
    client.call('beanstalk_example.background_counting', '5')

For a live example look at the `beanstalk_example` app, in the
`management/commands/beanstalk_example_client.py` file. Arguments to `call` are

    priority: an integer number that specifies the priority. Jobs with a
              smaller priority get executed first
    delay:    how many seconds to wait before the job can be reserved
    ttr:      how many seconds a worker has to process the job before it gets requeued


Example App
-----------
For a full, working, example application, add `beanstalk_example` to your
`INSTALLED_APPS`, then run a worker in one shell:

    python manage.py beanstalk_worker -w 4

and execute the example app in another:

    python manage.py beanstalk_example_client

You can see the client sending data and the worker(s) working on it.
